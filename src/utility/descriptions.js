  "I've recently graduated from UCI class of 2018 with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. I'm currently looking for work and aspiring to become a front end web developer. I have been learning ReactJS and other front end tools for less than a year now and have done a couple of projects with it, including this portfolio website you're now seeing. I have just scratched the surface of the amazing things you can build on the web and I'm always yearning to grow and improve my knowledge of it. Let's grow and learn together.";

export const codingCardDescription =
  "I have been coding for about 7 years now with Java being my very first programming language. I've enjoyed the logic and the challenge of it ever since. I've done numerous projects in college which you will be able to see on my github but recently my main focus has been front end web development. My strong foundation and fundamentals in coding has helped me gain a better understanding for front end coding practices and problem solving.";

export const reactCardDescription =
  "Using React as a tool for web development has made it so much more fun and easier to manage code when it comes to building a website. Especially with their use of components, states and being able to download packages to help make life easier for you. I started off learning the basics of HTML/CSS/Javascript but learned about React. It has been a really fun challenge and time creating websites/web apps through React and I'm hoping to make a career out of it. You can see my recent projects on it here on this website.";

export const bootstrapCardDescription =
  "Bootstrap has helped me learn how to make responsive designs along with learning good web design practices in general. It has made it quicker and less of a hassle dealing with CSS but Bootstrap definitely still can't do everything CSS can do. Learning the building blocks of both CSS and HTML helps leverage the use of Bootstrap to make it even more powerful to the average user. It's fun using it and combining it with ReactJS to try to build innovative web apps.";
